Hey this is a quick message to the guy who runs the TKR Github site and is currently working on the new mod. I have pretty much no way to contact you but I think you've seen in your chat what I've said about wanting to work with you now. <br>
I have no way to refer to you or message you tho so I had to by proposing a change to this github thingy (also I have no idea who tkr racist or tkr yakusa are, unless thats one of you). <br>
